How to Set It Up on Your Raspberry Pi:
Create a Project Directory:

Open a terminal on your Pi and run these commands:

Bash

mkdir /home/pi/choreboard
cd /home/pi/choreboard
Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

This keeps your project's dependencies separate from system-wide packages.

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install Flask Flask-Cors
Save the Python Code:

Save the Python code from the first document above into a file named choreboard_server.py inside your /home/pi/choreboard directory.

Create the systemd Service File:

Use a text editor to create the service file. nano is easy to use.

Bash

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/choreboard.service
Copy the content from the second document above and paste it into the editor.

Crucially, edit the WorkingDirectory and ExecStart paths to match where you saved your project.

Save the file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter.

Enable and Start the Service:

Tell systemd to recognize the new file and enable it to start on boot:

Bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable choreboard.service
sudo systemctl start choreboard.service
Check the Status:

You can check if it's running correctly with:

Bash

sudo systemctl status choreboard.service
You should see a green "active (running)" message. If not, this command will show you any errors.
